## Introduction 

The aim of this project is to create a page where I can keep everything in the one place. A personal organisation app for  daily habits, diary, recipes and whatever other widgets which will be added for organisation. 

The aim is to have information saved to a database. To give reminders and notifications if something hasn't been done in the day yet.
